# Entry for LD45 - Start with Nothing

This game is a Rust project using the quicksilver 2D game framework.

It can be run locally by invoking `cargo run` in the project directory.

Resources are located in the `static/` folder.

Note the code is very messy due to the make-game-in-two-days constraint.
